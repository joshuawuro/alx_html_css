<h1>Implement a design from scratch</h1>
<p>
    In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously. <br>

    You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file. <br>

    Here the final result:
</p>

<img src="./60df485eb772ecbad54a.jpg" alt="design" width="100%">

<p>
    This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
    <li>you are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)</li>
    <li>you are not to use Javascript</li>
</ul>


<h1>TASKS</h1>
<h2>0. Read and be familiar with Figma</h2>
<p>
    Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details. <br>

    If you can’t access it, please find here the Figma file <br>

    Important notes with Figma:

    <ul>
        <li>if your computer doesn’t have the fonts used, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT</li>
        <li>some values are in float - feel free to round them</li>
    </ul>

    For this task, please write an amazing README.md
</p>

<h3>Interactions note:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less</li>
    <li>links hover/active: #FF6565</li>
    <li>button hover/active: opacity: 0.9</li>
    <li>max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page</li>
</ul>

<h3>Repo:</h3>

</ul>


<h2>3. Header</h2>
<p>
    Building a web page the right way, is not easy - except if you put in place strong foundations:

    <ul>
        <li>reset CSS styling</li>
        <li>use variables</li>
        <li>simple (as generic as you can) CSS selectors</li>
        <li>avoid (as much as you can) super specific CSS selector</li>
        <li>simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!</li>
    </ul>

    Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

    Now, your turn!

    For this first task: create the header/hero piece

    Here an archive of all assets needed: images_.zip
</p>

<h3>Repo:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub repository: alx_html_css</li>
    <li>Directory: headphones</li>
    <li>File: 1-index.html, 1-styles.css</li>
</ul>



<h2>4. "What we do..." section</h2>
<p>
    Copy files from the previous task.

    For this second task: <strong>create the “What we do…” section</strong>
    
    In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.
    
    <strong>Important:</strong> try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.
</p>

<h3>Repo:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub repository: alx_html_css</li>
    <li>Directory: headphones</li>
    <li>File: 1-index.html, 1-styles.css</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. "Our results" section</h2>
<p>
    Copy files from the previous task.

    For this third task: <strong>create the “Our results” section</strong>

    Now you can reuse components form the previous task!
</p>

<h3>Repo:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub repository: alx_html_css</li>
    <li>Directory: headphones</li>
    <li>File: 2-index.html, 2-styles.css</li>
</ul>


<h2>6. Contact us</h2>
<p>
    Copy files from the previous task.

    A good landing page has always a contact form.

    You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.
</p>

<h3>Repo:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub repository: alx_html_css</li>

</ul>


<h2>7. Footer</h2>

    And you are done!

    <strong>Good job!</strong>

<h2>8. Replace background image with... code!</h2>
<p>
    In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.
</p>

<h3>Repo:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>GitHub repository: alx_html_css</li>
    <li>Directory: headphones</li>
    <li>File: 6-index.html, 6-styles.css</li>
</ul>


<h2>8. Replace background image with... code!</h2>
<p>
    From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row. Either all the time, either when hover.

    Scaling, opacity, rotation, bouncing… many options!
